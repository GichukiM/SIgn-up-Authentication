## USER AUTHENTICATION

- Install necessary dependencies for various folders ie for backed and front-end

## To Run the backed, navigate to backed folder then to server then run 
`` flask run --port 8080 `` 

## Run react app and on the url navigate to the signUp 

`` http://127.0.0.1:5173/register `` 
- to signup then you will be directed to the login page which should take you to the Dashboard once you are logged in.

## See how you can intergrate perhaps these code into our previous one or vice versa. 

## Point to note is i have used vite instead of create react app.
